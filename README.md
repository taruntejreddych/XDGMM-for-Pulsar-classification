# XDGMM-for-Pulsar-classification
Collected the P, P_dot data from https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/ and applied XDGMM after filtering the fliers from the data.
The ellipses are the boundaries which classify the pulsars into different regions based on their locations and emitting spectra.
